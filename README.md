# Algorithm for QR Decomposition
## Aim:
To implement QR decomposition algorithm using the Gram-Schmidt method.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
1.	Intialize the matrix Q and u
2.	The vector u and e is given by

        R[j, j] = np.linalg.norm(v)
        Q[:, j] = v / R[j, j]
    return Q, R
    
a = np.array(eval(input()))

Q, R = QR_Decomposition(a)
print(Q)
print(R)
